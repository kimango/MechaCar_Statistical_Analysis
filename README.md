# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview
The project used the statistics and hypothesis tests to check the series of datasets from the automotive industry. 

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

 * The R-square is 0.71 or 71% of the variations in mpg can be descried by changes in the vehicle length, the vehicle weight, the spoiler angle, the drivetrain and the ground clearance. We can consider this linear model as structured to predict mpg of MechaCar models.

## Summary of Suspension Coils
  * All Manufucturing Lot

   * Each Manufucturing Lot

   * The specs showed that all manufacturing lots in total with a global variance of 62.3 psi.
   * Lot 1 has a variance of 0.98 psi, Lot 2 has a variance of 7.47 psi and Lot 3 has 170.

## T-test on Suspension Coils
   * T-Test All Manufucturing Lots vs. Population Mean
